# SN8F2288 GUI

Interactive disassembler and emulator for the SN8F2288.

**This is a work in progress.** At the moment only very basic disassembly is supported. Some of the emulation has been written but is not yet integrated with the GUI. The plan is to eventually support a virtual USB device in [QEMU](https://github.com/mrexodia/qemu-sn8f2288).
